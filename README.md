# Contentful UI Extension to Build Gatsby Site on AWS

This extension allows editors to trigger preview builds for Gatsby sites on AWS and borrows from a similar extension to build Gatsby sites on Netlify.

The extension takes two values - the webhook URL (which is probably an API Gateway endpoint) and the name of the CodePipeline job.
